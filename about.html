    <h1 class = "title">About Me</h1>

    <img id = me src = "assets/me.jpeg" width= 350px>

    <p id = bio> Hey! My name is Kaylee Nam but you can call me Kaz! I'm a sophomore at Rice University who has been learning computer science since 8th grade and
<br>
      is super passionate about human-computer interaction, science and technology studies, and DEI in tech.
      <br>
Iâ€™m also a queer nonbinary teen who really cares about diversity and equity in the industry.
<br>
      <br>
For my extracurriculars, I am a co-president of clubs, co-director of external affairs, and on the travel team for my school's Model UN chapter. I am also the webmaster for my local chapter of NHS and a teen led climate activist group called Sunrise. I am currently a branch founder of AiGo Learning.
<br>
      <br>
I also dabble in many other hobbies including fashion, art, video editing, and baking. I love all kinds of music (except maybe country), hanging out with my friends, and the witching hour. </p>
