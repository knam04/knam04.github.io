    <p id = bio>
      Hey! My name is Kaylee Nam but you can call me Kaz! I'm a sophomore at Rice University
      who has been learning computer science since 8th grade and is super passionate about human-computer interaction, science and technology studies, and DEI in tech.
      <br>
      <br>
      On campus, I'm involved in research, design clubs, and leadership clubs. Currently, I'm working with a professor from Rice to develop instructional tools to teach college-level computer science students about Java execution and with a postdoc from
      Lehigh University to write a paper on reverse-engineering methods. I'm also a member of Rice Design for America, where we work with local organizations to design unique solutions for specific problems. Last semester, I worked with a team of 4 to design
      solutions for The Council on Recovery, an addiction treatment center based in Houston, Texas. Right now, I'm working with the national chapter of DFA to design solutions for patient falls at MaineHealth psychiatric hospitals.
      I'm also the Head of Design for Adaptive Skating, a club meant to teach Houston youth with mental or physical disabilities ice-skating.
      <br>
      <br>
      I also dabble in game development, photography, and video editing. I love discovering new coffeeshops and hanging out with friends.
      To contact me, my email is kn36 (at) rice (dot) edu!
